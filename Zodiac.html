            <h3>Monkey</h3>
            <p>The monkey is a clever, lively, and witty animal. Because of a lot of similarities to humans, the monkey is admired by people in many cultures and Chinese culture is no exception. In traditional Chinese culture, monkey has been considered a mascot to pray for the luck of official career as it pronounces the same with the Chinese character for “marquis (hou)” in ancient times. In some west areas of China, monkey is also believed to be able to protect little babies from evil spirits.
